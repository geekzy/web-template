<h2>Wireframe Notes</h2>
<p>Wireframes created by: Chris Drabsch, Daydream Graphics - <a href="mailto:chris@daydreamgraphics.com.au">Click here to email Chris</a></p>

    <h3>Important information</h3>
        These wireframes are to be interpreted only as indicators of the structure and content arrangement of the finished website. They do not indicate any visual or stylistic appearance, or conceptual treatment. Headlines are set in a serif font to contrast with other text on the website. These wireframes are only tested in Chrome, a Webkit-based browser. They are currently untested in Firefox, IE or Safari, so for accurate results, please view this demo in Chrome.
    <h3>Functionality</h3>
        The menu system is fully functional unless otherwise stated. Some pages use generic layout pages if the content is not yet defined. Individual details for each page will be developed during the later stages of the project.
    To see detail pages for each category page, click on the grey image on any page. Some links may work, others may not, as they are primarily there for visualisation purposes.
    Though you are viewing functional HTML pages, these are still very early drafts of the final templates, and as such there may be bugs or other errors. Please report any issues you find.
    <h3>Mobile / Tablet View</h3>
        To simulate how these wireframes appear on a mobile handset or tablet, scale your browser window down until the view is a narrow strip approx 300px wide. Please note, this only works in Chrome / Firefox / Safari, but not in IE. Also note that this has been untested and there may be bugs or errors - please report anything you find.
